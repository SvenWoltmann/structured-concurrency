# Structure Concurrency Examples

This repository contains several examples for "Structured Concurrency",
a feature described in [JEP 453](https://openjdk.org/jeps/453)
and available in [Java 21](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/java-21-features/) 
as a preview feature.

I use these examples in my presentations on structured concurrency.

## Java 21 IDE Support

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) supports Java 21 as of version 2023.2.2.
As long as this version is not yet released,
you can install the release candidate via the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
by going into the IntelliJ IDEA settings and activating the "Early Access Program".


## Java Downloads

You can download Java 21 from here: https://jdk.java.net/21/

To install multiple Java versions on Linux or macOS, I recommend using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

To install multiple Java versions on Windows,
have a look at this tutorial: [How to Change Java Versions in Windows](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/)
